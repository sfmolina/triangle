-- | Checks if there exists a triangle in a given graph.
-- A triangle is a set of three vertices in a graph that are pairwise connected by edges.
-- 
-- The function takes a 'Graph' as input and returns 'True' if a triangle exists, and 'False' otherwise.
-- 
-- The 'Graph' type is defined as follows:
-- 
-- @
-- data Graph = G (S.Set Int) (S.Set (Int, Int))
-- @
-- 
-- The first argument of the 'Graph' constructor is a set of vertices, represented by integers.
-- The second argument is a set of edges, represented by pairs of vertices.
-- 
-- The function uses the 'cn3' function to generate all possible sets of three vertices from the given graph -> Combinations(|vs|,3).
-- It then checks if any of these sets satisfy the condition for a triangle, which is that all three pairs of vertices are connected by edges.
-- 
-- The 'cn3' function returns a set of all possible combinations of three vertices from the given set of vertices.
-- 
-- The 'condition' function checks if a given set of three vertices forms a triangle by checking if all three pairs of vertices are present in the set of edges.
-- 
-- The function uses the 'any' function to check if there exists any set of three vertices that satisfy the condition for a triangle.
-- 
-- The function returns 'True' if a triangle exists, and 'False' otherwise.
